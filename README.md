# Fumo-bot
Fumos are japanese plushies of characters from the game series Tohou.
This bot is designed to work with the [Fumo-API](https://github.com/nosesisaid/fumo-api).
Version 2.0 of the Fumo-bot completley rewritten in Rust, second project I create in rust (this is really difficult help get typescript back) and very cool.
### Features
